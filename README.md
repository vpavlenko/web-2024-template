# How to Cursor in React

In this guide you'll develop your own web application from scratch using plain English in the Cursor IDE. Cursor is the leading AI-powered code editor, capable of instantly making code changes in complex projects across multiple files.

The development process is changing rapidly. Instead of learning programming languages and frameworks, you'll now need to carefully decompose projects into tasks, provide sufficient context to LLM helpers, and know how to recover from dead ends. Once you master this, you'll be able to start projects outside your area of expertise, even without any developers.

This React+TypeScript+Vite+MUI template allows you to run it locally in a Cursor IDE. Replace it with your logic and deploy to web.

This guide will take around 1 to 2 hours of your time.

## A simple html app

Before we dive into React, let's spend 10-20 minutes in a simpler setup.

1. Install [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/). If you had it installed before, Cmd+Shift+P "Attempt Update" to get the latest update
3. As you're in a `.cursortutor` project, press `Cmd+I` (`Ctrl+I`) and ask Cursor to make a simple website. Ask for any functionality and UI. Try asking in your language (Spanish, Polish etc.):
```
Create a simple html website with easy conversion between 7 main time zones.
Time in all of theme is displayed simultaneously, and I can change hh and mm
in any of them in one click or by typing.
```

4. Click `[Accept All]`. Trust Cursor, don't read the code that it generated ‚Äì it's not relevant for this task:
<img width="874" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 13 07 19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1db29fba-8814-4290-ad67-4830d9315301">

5. Open this file `index.html` in your browser (File -> Open):
<img width="588" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 13 10 37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75d2b489-c4bd-4c70-9f60-8fb3b52d3e40">

6. In the same Composer chat, ask for changes:

```
Make a solid-looking modern UI, draw real clock faces for each,
align them horizontally, also draw HH:MM numbers.
```
<img width="871" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 13 11 56" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fee8527-c21e-4a1d-a35e-523665f6d2d5">


Again, click `[Accept All]` when available and refresh your page in the browser:

<img width="1123" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 13 13 45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af5511e2-5bf8-45e6-ab14-72a6559e27f1">

7. Try different ideas. You may retry from scratch with a completely different idea in mind. How would you prompt to get that? Research prompt techniques online.

<img width="1120" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 13 31 56" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68c64181-2cae-47ba-b71f-e8a76fbd9772">

8. This was a simple single-file application. The true power of Cursor comes in instantly making changes throughout many files in a big project. This allows you to build complex features. For that, we need to use a React library and some tooling - which is what this template's files provide.



## Get the tools ready

1. Go here -> [and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) version 20
   - On Windows, do it directly to Windows, NOT to WSL-Ubuntu.
   - Don't try installing via your package manager, or you can get an outdated Node version like v12. You need at least v18 for Vite.
5. [Log into Github](https://github.com/login)

Optionally watch [my stream in Russian](https://www.youtube.com/live/NVnHvsuc5Fc)


## Run locally
Fork this repo:

<img width="1191" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 22 04 00" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f31a473-30c9-4e3b-abc7-69edd4011459">

Then clone it locally using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

Then open this project (`atm-todos`) in Cursor (`üìÅ Open a folder`), open `package.json`, hover `dev` on line 7 and click `Run Script`:

<img width="616" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 11 49 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a75d0dd3-41a9-4730-a25b-b4accc867e09">

Then open the link it gives in your browser.

<img width="1005" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 11 52 29" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fbff3f8-be54-43af-80f3-fc8ed846cf2c">

## Make changes

Open `src/App.tsx`, then press Cmd+I (or Ctrl+I), then type your request or paste a screenshot of a desired UI. Eg.
```
Instead of a todo list app, make an app to store and edit recipes for dishes.
Allow to recalculate number of portions for each dish.
Populate with 5 boilerplate dishes.
Make funky styling.
```

You can write your mother tounge (Spanish, Polish etc.) - it'll [understand](https://chatgpt.com/share/66fbdfda-a314-800f-997d-1cedbc9f4f92)

Hit Enter, then once it's done - hit Acccept All and reload your live demo in the browser.

## Save changes (commit)

See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if anything fails.

Once you've changed anything, open <img width="263" alt="372839934-8672006e-9198-4399-9169-0086bf01e961" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/371824e8-420c-4143-8de1-b1b310d78cd5">
 in Cursor, write a commit message in the Message field (a short summary of your changes).

If you wrote a message, press `[Commit]`, then press `[Sync]`.

The UI here is annoying and humiliating, I know. 

You may also do it from GitHub Desktop. 

If you're lost, open a Terminal, press Cmd+K (Ctrl+K) and describe what you want from Git in plain English.

## Deploy

Open `package.json` and run a deploy script:

<img width="822" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 21 08 37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/facd4e44-17e5-4bb6-a762-310a6e6bd28c">


If you get errors during deployment, copy them from terminal, paste them to Cursor's Composer, and it'll try to fix. Then retry deploying until it succeeds.

Then enable the website link on Github: uncheck and check back the ‚úÖ `Use your GitHub Pages website`:

<img width="1086" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 22 14 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fa99fc3-c359-4113-b328-7c5da738eb7c">

<img width="1137" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 22 15 58" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dd5b7d8-4478-4693-bf84-0a466ebbfbda">

<img width="1437" alt="–°–Ω–∏–º–æ–∫ —ç–∫—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ 2024-10-02 –≤ 15 15 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/047dca0c-b01f-4b52-bd8f-db6598b27feb">


You should see your changes live.

## Tips

- Break down new functionality into smallest possible bits. Don't bundle several unrelated features: if you get an error for one of them, you'll lose more time retrying
- Once a Cursor made any small step in the right direction - commit
- Press "+" to start a new Composer and erase unnecessary previous context. Cursor knows what you did before because it looks into the current code
- If Cursor broke things: either Reject All, press "+" and start from the last commit; or try 2-3 attempts at sending error messages to it and ask to fix
- Use `@Codebase` and also mention all files that might have a relevant context
- Ask Cursor to add a debug output and paste it to composer
- Ask Cursor to add a debug UI at the right place in your application. Ask to print out all relevant app state there
- Try attaching reference screenshots and mockups as images to Composer
- Try building anything with OpenAI API, use `@OpenAI`
- Use `@Docs` and `@Web`
- [Search Youtube for tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kPr1vy0-QY)
- Read about [features](https://www.cursor.com/features)
- Read [the docs](https://docs.cursor.com/)

# This is so tough, can I do it simpler?

You can try [Replit Agent](https://docs.replit.com/replitai/agent), although this will cost you $25 (no free trial). UX/vision-wise, it's mind-blowing. However, I can't get any meaningful results out of it so far. Also, it's heavily leaning towards Flask.

Worth trying, but it's 2024, so LLMs can still be silly.



# Do I need a backend?

Do you?

If you simply want to persist data, ask Cursor to save data in local storage. 

If you need to persist it across users or devices, ask Cursor to use [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/)

If you need authorization, ask Cursor to use [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/)

If you need a logic to process user's data on the backend - start with [Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Adding Firestore to the project

1. Ask Cursor:
```
Save data to Firestore
```
2. Log into https://console.firebase.google.com/
3. Create a project.
4. Select "Cloud Firestore", create a database in **test mode**:

<img width="895" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 15 41 39" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c69af68e-622b-4276-a612-0d2c914c92d1">

6. In `‚öôÔ∏è Project Settings` create a web app **</>** (no **Firebase Hosting** needed):

<img width="1089" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 15 43 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5973592c-af22-44d6-8ad3-2e22f36e26d4">

8. Copy `firebaseConfig` to the file that Cursor created for it:

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaNdPrtYYZO3Mo9gmNTQFwqI8fSdn-jKTuWA",
  authDomain: "your-app-43gh9.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-app-43gh9",
  storageBucket: "your-app-43gh9.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "783999999999",
  appId: "1:783553619737:web:dff6fce9589deaf34",
  measurementId: "G-JL7GNDPV6V"
};
```

9. Reload your app, make sure it has saved the data to the database.
9. Open your database and try to see it there:

<img width="850" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 16 17 23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb790a30-9ea0-4cfb-b4e7-ca068173e30b">

10. If something breaks, ask Cursor to add a debug output for all Firebase requests.

# How to create a Telegram bot?

1. Create an empty folder on your computer.
2. File -> Open Folder it in Cursor.
3. `Cmd+I` (`Ctrl+I`), type `create a simple telegram bot`.
   - Read carefully what it tells you to do
   - If something doesn't work, replace `pip` with `pip3` and `python` with `python3`
   - You need to kill (Ctrl+C) and rerun your `python3 bot.py` after every code change - since python scripts don't automatically reload after their code has been changed.

# Backup

4. Type `git` to your terminal. If git is not found, install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
6. If you never committed to git on this machine, run in the terminal with your own name and email:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
and
```
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

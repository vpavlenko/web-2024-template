You are an expert in TypeScript, React, and Material UI.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Importing React from "react" is unnecessary and should be avoided.
- If you add any param for API key, create a separate file for them, import API keys from it and don't rewrite API keys entered by the user.

Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names.
- Use camelCase for function and variable names.
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use const objects instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use arrow functions for component definitions and callbacks.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

- Use Material UI components and icons for all UI elements.
- Utilize Material UI's styling solutions (e.g., styled, makeStyles, or sx prop) for custom styling.
- Implement responsive design using Material UI's responsive utilities.
- When creating custom UI components, use styled-components for styling.

Material UI Usage

- Import Material UI components from @mui/material.
- Import Material UI icons from @mui/icons-material.
- Use Material UI's theming system for consistent styling.

Performance Optimization

- Use React.memo() for pure functional components when necessary.
- Utilize useMemo and useCallback hooks to optimize performance.
- Implement code splitting for large applications.

Debugging and Troubleshooting

- After 1-2 iterations of debugging, if progress seems slow, suggest implementing debug output.
- Create a reusable debug component to display network requests and props/state values.
- Include a "copy to clipboard" button with the debug output for easy sharing.
- Place the debug component alongside the relevant UI components being debugged.
- If you suspect we're hitting CORS-related network errors, use @https://corsproxy.io/ to wrap requests: const url = 'https://corsproxy.io/?' + encodeURIComponent('https://api.domain.com/...');

State Management

- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) for state management.
- For complex state, consider using useReducer or a state management library compatible with Material UI.

Data Storage

- For local storage, use the localStorage API.
- For web/cloud storage, use Firestore.
- Create a separate file (e.g., firebaseConfig.ts) for Firestore configuration and import it where needed.

Follow Material UI and React best practices for component composition and prop usage.
